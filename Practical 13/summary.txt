3,The range of percentage identities in the reported online BLAST results
Online BLAST Results: For the human SOD2 protein query against the UniProt database with the BLAST search restricted to Eutheria, 1445 hits were obtained. 
The range of percentage identity among the retrieved alignments was from 58.1% to 100%. 
The alignment with the mouse SOD2 protein (UniProt ID: P09671) had a percentage identity of 90.1%.

4, The alignment score and percentage of identical amino acids for each of the
three comparisons that you performed using Python:
The pre_identity between human and mouse is: 90.09009009009009

The pre_identity between human and random is: 6.306306306306306

The pre_identity between mouse and random is: 6.756756756756757

The blosum score between human and mouse is: 1097.0

The blosum score between human and random is: -209.0

The blosum score between mouse and random is: -205.0

5，A statement recording which of these two sequences are most closely related：
As both precentage of identical and alignment score between human and mouse is highest,
human sequence and mouse sequence are most closely related
